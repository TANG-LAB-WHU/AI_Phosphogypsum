Supplementary Figure 7: Numerical example of the life cycle calculations underlying the internal costs for the Net Balance of production option number 3 for P-fertilisers through advanced P-recovery (NB3) in High Density Areas (HDA, box a) and Low Density Areas (LDA, box b). The result for NB3 is obtained by subtracting the current-day management and use of an equivalent feedstock mass required to produce the functional unit in the AP system (CF3) from the life cycle impacts for the advanced P-manufacturing and use (AP3). Hence,  $\mathrm{NB3} = \mathrm{AP3} - \mathrm{CF3}$  (box d). These impacts from NB can be compared to the linear system for the production and use of  $1\mathrm{kg}$  bioavailable P in a concentrated P-fertiliser derived from rock phosphate (RP) (box c). The consequential model applied reflects physical and monetary causalities and the consequences associated to the substitution of displaced activities are considered (blue boxes with dotted lines, both present in AP3 and CF3). Note that the functional unit, i.e. the production and use-on-land of one kg of bioavailable P in a concentrated P-fertiliser ( $\geq 4\%$  P), is only fulfilled in AP (red box on top), but that P present in organic fertilising materials ( $< 4\%$  P) is credited by assuming the displacement of the production and use of mineral P-fertilisers (in conjunction with displacement of mineral N and K to credit for bioavailable N and K in organic fertilising material) (see CF3 in LDA; Supplementary Figure 7b). This approach thus recognises the nutrient value of organic fertilising materials in terms of P (as well as of N and K), and appropriately credits the system for not returning bioavailable P in such materials due to the implementation of advanced P-recovery (see numerical example that contrasts the dissimilar return of bioavailable P in CF in HDA versus LDA). All values are expressed per functional unit, i.e. as  $\mathrm{EUR~kg^{-1}}$  bio-available P in a concentrated P-fertiliser (rounded values).

# 2.1 Discernibility analysis – High Population and Livestock Density Areas

# Supplementary information available

Supplementary

Table 1

Results of the discernibility analysis for the impact categories focused in this study (Montecarlo analysis; 1000 iterations) for High population and livestock Density Areas. For each impact category, the percentage indicates the number of occurrences when the scenario in a column (e.g. NB1) performed better than the scenario in a row (e.g. NB2). For example, in the category Climate Change, NB1 performed better than B2 in  $93\%$  of the occurrences, better than NB3 in  $98\%$  of the occurrences, and better than RP in  $100\%$  of the occurrences. NB: Net Balance (AP-CF). RP: Rock Phosphate.

# Explanatory notes

Supplementary Table 1 illustrates the results of the discernibility analysis for each individual impact category considered in the study. In life cycle assessment, the discernibility analysis is a pair-by-pair evaluation of the difference between scenarios, aiming to present the percentage of occurrences where one scenario achieves better results than another. As stressed in previous studies, the uncertainty of the difference between two scenarios might depend on shared parameters, as often the scenarios have processes (and associated parameters) in common (e.g. two scenarios may have in common the same anaerobic digestion or incineration process). Owing to this, some uncertainties may have the same influence on the two scenarios but no influence on their actual ranking (i.e. they cancel each other out when performing the discernibility analysis).

Environmental and health impacts for (a) Climate Change, (b) Freshwater Eutrophication - aquatic, (c) Marine Eutrophication - aquatic, (d) Ecotoxicity, (e) Human Toxicity - non-cancer, and (f) Human Toxicity - cancer effects in High population and livestock Density Areas resulting from the production of  $1\mathrm{kg}$  bioavailable P as described in Fig. 2 of the main text. The left hand part of each graph (white background) indicates the impacts for advanced P-recovery manufacturing and use (AP) and current-day feedstock management and use (CF), disaggregated for different process and life cycle stages, as well as impacts from the manufacturing and use of single superphosphate sourced from rock phosphate (RP). The right hand part of each graph indicates the overall results  $(\mathrm{NB} = \mathrm{AP} - \mathrm{CF} \& \mathrm{RP})$

for the default scenario (mean and error bars indicating plus minus one standard deviation), and energy, export and plant P demand uncertainty variants when results are located outside the error bars for the default scenario. Pathways NB1-NB6 associated to a net saving relative to pathway RP are displayed on the green background; pathways NB1-NB6 associated to a net burden relative to pathway RP are displayed on the red background.

# Explanatory notes

The environmental and health impacts for Low population and livestock Density Areas (LDA) are presented in Supplementary Figure 1. The main paper shows results for High population and livestock Density Areas (HDA) since the implementation opportunities are larger in these areas.

# Explanatory notes

Supplementary Figures 2-to-5 illustrate the parameters with the largest contribution (i.e. importance) to the overall uncertainty for each individual result. The parameters, depending upon their nature, are classified into the following aggregated groups: i) feedstock composition, ii) technology, iii) use-on-land, iv) NPK other substitution, v) transport and vi) storage. Supplementary Table 3 lists and describes the parameters applied that belong to each of these groups and have a contribution larger than  $10\%$  on the overall uncertainty in at least one impact category. Additional details on the parameters used in the assessment and associated uncertainty can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

# Explanatory notes

Based on the primary data collected from operators, dewatering incurred, per tonne of total solids (TS) in input, a consumption of  $61.2\mathrm{kWh}$  electricity and  $11\mathrm{kg}$  polyelectrolyte. Granulation incurred, per tonne of non-granulated P-fertilizer to be treated, a consumption of 6 MJ natural gas,  $4.9\mathrm{kg}$  heat,  $17.7\mathrm{kWh}$  electricity and  $0.4\mathrm{L}$  diesel. CAPEX, labour, insurance and maintenance costs for dewatering and granulation units were disregarded, as expected to be minor. Disposal of residual waste (residues after processing of P-containing ash, e.g. acidulation) was modelled as in ref. $^{18}$  assuming disposal in a mineral (inert) landfill.

# Explanatory notes

Transport was assumed to occur with a truck 28-32 t, consuming 2.48E-05 kg diesel  $\mathrm{km}^{-1}$  with a usage rate of  $27,000\ \mathrm{t}\ \mathrm{y}^{-1}$  and 6a lifetime. The initial investment cost (CAPEX) was assumed to be equal to  $276,000\ \mathrm{€}^{19}$ . Maintenance and insurance were assumed to equal  $7\%$  and  $1.4\%$  of the CAPEX based on ref. This translates into a cost, per tonne transported, equal to  $10.3\ \mathrm{€}\ \mathrm{t}^{1}$  ( $2.9\ \mathrm{€}$  for the sum of CAPEX, maintenance and insurance,  $5.7\ \mathrm{€}$  for labour,  $1.7\ \mathrm{€}$  for fuel). The transport distances assumed were:

- Transport of raw biomass to processing plant or to use-on-land:  $25\mathrm{km}$

- Transport of P-fertilisers, raw digestate, and liquid fraction to use-on-land: 25km

(only applies for LDA; combustion of solid fraction applies for HDA)

- Transport of solid fraction to further treatment (thermal or use-on-land): 25km

- Transport of thermal ashes to further treatment:  $25\mathrm{km}$

- Transport of residues to disposal:  $25\mathrm{km}$

- Transport of phosphate rock to EU was based on ref.20

Supplementary Table 19

Default values and uncertainty ranges for emissions resulting from storage of concentrated P-fertilisers and organic fertilising materials prior to land application. AP: advanced P-recovery manufacturing and use; CF: current-day feedstock management and use; na: not applicable.

# Explanatory notes

Storage is included as a life cycle stage prior to agricultural land application for concentrated P-fertilisers and organic fertilising materials, but not prior to processing/manufacturing steps such as anaerobic digestion, composting or advanced P-recovery manufacturing steps. The application of "best-available techniques (BAT)" as described in the recently published Best Available Techniques Reference Document for intensive rearing $^{21}$  is presumed, resulting in a significant reduction in emissions relative to storage under inappropriate conditions. For this study, it is specifically assumed that (i) organic slurries and liquid organic fractions are stored in silos equipped with a polyester cover; (ii) solid organic fractions are kept as covered field heaps with a concrete floor and a leachate collection system; and (iii) concentrated P-fertilisers are stored indoors under dry form in a concrete silo, and no product losses were assumed.

The estimation of the  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ ,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  losses from storage were estimated based on data from refs. $^{21-25}$  (Supplementary Table 19). Values were corrected for cover-induced emissions reductions using data from ref. $^{21}$ , if applicable.  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ ,  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  losses from separated digestates were attributed to the liquid digestate fraction $^{26}$ , no N and  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  losses due to storage were assumed for the solid digestate fraction. Nitrogen leaching during storage was assumed not to occur due to configuration of the selected storage systems. Average storage losses across the different products and materials were assumed to vary from  $0\%$  to  $11\%$  of the methane potential for  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ , from  $0\%$  to  $0.5\%$  of total N for  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  emissions, and from  $0\%$  to  $3.6\%$  of total N for  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  emissions (Supplementary Table 19). Cost data for storage are as follows: 4.1 Euro tonne $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$ , 1.7 Euro tonne $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$  and 6.4 Euro tonne $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$ , and for liquid manure fractions, solid manure fractions/digested sewage sludge, and P-fertilisers based on ref. $^{21}$ .

# Explanatory notes

It was considered that concentrated P-fertilisers were applied according to best management practices on P-deficient soils on a flat terrain. Based on meta-analysis results that include data from both laboratory and field experiments, the ratio of bioavailable P to total P in the concentrated P-fertilisers was assumed 1.0 for AP1, AP4, AP5 and RP (struvite, TSP, SSP-like substance, and SSP), 0.93 for AP2 (poultry litter ash), 0.90 for AP3 (AshDec® rhenanite-like P-substance) and 0.85 for AP6 (pig manure biochar) $^{27}$ . Regardless of the chemical composition of the concentrated P-fertiliser, P losses to water were estimated at  $8\%$  of the P applied, equally distributed over losses to surface waters through run-off ( $4\%$ ; range  $3.2 - 4.8\%$ ) and groundwater through leaching ( $4\%$ ; range  $3.2 - 4.8\%$ ) $^{28}$ . It was assumed that plant uptake corresponds to  $90\%$  of the bioavailable P applied. Hence, plant P uptake was assumed  $90\%$  of the total P applied for SSP (RP), and concentrated P-fertilisers that have a similar chemical composition than mined and synthetic P-fertilisers (AP4, AP5). plant P uptake from concentrated P-fertilisers that have a different chemical composition than mined and synthetic P-fertilisers was calculated as  $90\%$  ( $72 - 97\%$ ),  $84\%$  ( $67 - 97\%$ ),  $81\%$  ( $65 - 97\%$ ), and  $76\%$  ( $38 - 97\%$ ) for struvite (AP1), poultry litter ash (AP2), AshDec® rhenanite-like P-substance (AP3) substance, and pig manure biochar (AP6), respectively. Phosphorus stored in the soil was assumed to correspond to P applied minus the combined plant P uptake and P loss to water bodies. Nitrogen present in struvite was assumed to displace the production and field application of mineral N fertilisers in a 1:1 substitution ratio (AP1;  $1\mathrm{kg}$  of struvite-N displaces  $1\mathrm{kg}$  of N present in a mineral N-fertiliser). For N in pig manure biochar (AP6), a 0.1:1 substitution ratio was assumed due to the documented low availability of heterocyclic N in the charred material $^{29}$ . Potassium was mostly present in low quantities in the concentrated P-fertilisers, with the exception of poultry litter ashes (AP2). Potassium present in concentrated P-products was assumed to displace the production and field application of mineral K fertilisers in a 1:1 substitution ratio $^{30}$ . Carbon in pig manure biochar (AP6) was assumed to have a long-term residence in the soil, with  $90\%$  of the C remaining after the considered time horizon of 100 years $^{31}$ . Other concentrated P-fertilisers contain carbon in marginal quantities and no further impacts were therefore attributed. The full inventory data for the use-on-land phase for concentrated P-fertilisers are documented in Supplementary Table 2 (parameters # 91 to 114).

# Explanatory notes

Land application on a flat arable terrain was assumed for the application of organic fertilising materials, here defined as biogenic feedstocks, or a fraction thereof, that are returned to agricultural land as a non-concentrated P materials of P content  $< 4\%$ . The wide variation in nutrient budgets and fates taking place across the EU, amongst others depending on soil types, climate conditions, topography and farm management practices[32] is acknowledged and considered as part of the uncertainty analysis. It was assumed that organic fertilising materials were applied at an application rate of  $50\mathrm{kgNha^{-1}yr^{-1}}$  and  $170\mathrm{kgNha^{-1}yr^{-1}}$  in LDA and HDA (note that only manure is landspread here), respectively. The limits are chosen to reflect situations of low-end and high-end manure and processed manure application scenarios based on the data presented for different EU regions in ref.[33]. Moreover, the maximal application rates of  $170\mathrm{kg}\mathrm{ha^{-1}yr^{-1}}$  correspond to the application limits laid down in the EU Nitrates Directive for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. N, P and K plant uptake from organic fertilising materials and N and K plant uptake from concentrated P-fertilisers was assumed to displace the production and use of mineral fertilisers.

Nitrogen was partitioned into inorganic and organic fractions throughout the life cycle system because a different behaviour was assumed for both N fractions, based on input material composition, partition coefficients during solid-liquid separation (90% of the mineral N to the liquid fraction), and N transformations during anaerobic digestion (increase of 45% in the relative share of  $\mathrm{NH_4}^+$ -N to total  $\mathrm{N}^{34}$ ). Storage was assumed not to change the distribution of the N between inorganic and organic forms. Mineral fertilisers were assumed to follow the dynamics described for inorganic N, whereas a weighted mean approach was applied for organic fertilising materials comprising both inorganic and organic N fractions. For inorganic N fractions, the nitrogen use efficiency was assumed 80% (range: 64%-96%), the mean value of the targeted ranges for good management practices as outlined by Brentup and Palliere<sup>35</sup>. No long-term storage in the soil compartment was assumed for inorganic N. Minimal losses of 1% were assumed for  $\mathrm{NH_3}$  emissions and N run-off losses under good management practices (i.e. soil incorporation). In line with general trends for N loss values for intensive agriculture in Western Europe<sup>32,36</sup>, the remainder 18% was then assumed to be equally distributed between denitrification (9%) and N leaching losses to groundwater (9%). Based on the general trends observed in Europe<sup>32</sup>, denitrification was mostly attributed to  $\mathrm{N}_2$  losses (8%), and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  losses were assumed at 1% in line with IPCC default values<sup>37</sup>. For the

organic N, it was assumed that a stable organic N fraction of  $11\%$  was not available to the crops in the long-term and stored as soil organic matter in soils, in line with Bruun et al.38. Hence, it was assumed that  $89\%$  of the organic fraction was retained in the active biogeochemical N cycle, and this active fraction is further partitioned into plant uptake and gaseous/aqueous N losses. The nitrogen use efficiency of the active N fraction was assumed  $60\%$  (range:  $48 - 72\%$ )35. The supplementary N losses relative to inorganic N fractions were fully attributed to N leaching losses, resulting in a value of  $29\%$  for leaching losses from the active organic N fraction. These values are roughly in line with the values documented on N leaching from manure by FAO ( $\sim 30\%$ ). Other losses and emissions from the plant-available N fraction were assumed to be equal to inorganic N fractions:  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  losses ( $1\%$ ; low due to assumption of shallow injection), N surface run-off ( $1\%$ ),  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  losses ( $1\%$ ), and  $\mathrm{N}_2$  losses ( $8\%$ ). The modelled plant uptakes of N in LDA and HDA were assumed not to exceed plant N demands, in line with plant N requirements for most crops39. For the uncertainty analysis,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  emissions were assumed to vary between  $0.3\%$  and  $3\%$ . Plant N uptake was varied across the  $80 - 120\%$  range around the default value, and the N leaching range was then calculated from the total inputs minus losses and plant N uptake.

A  $85\%$  (68-96%) ratio of bioavailable P to total P was assumed for manure fractions<sup>40</sup>. For sewage sludge and meat-and-bone meal, the bioavailable P to total P ratio was assumed to be  $46\%$  (36-56%) and  $40\%$  (30-50%)<sup>41</sup>, respectively. Storage in the soil matrix was assumed as long-term fate for non-bioavailable P fractions. Losses to surface ( $4\%$ ; range 3.2-4.8%) and ground ( $4\%$ ; range 3.2-4.8%) water were assumed similar for mineral P-fertilisers. The ratio of bioavailable K to total K was assumed to be  $73\%$  for  $\mathrm{manure}^{40}$ , as well as for other fertilising materials. The losses of K were not further analysed as the K loss has no influence on any of the considered impact categories. Organic fertilising materials may be characterised by imbalanced stoichiometric ratios, especially N/P ratios. As a result, the application of high amounts of organic fertilising materials can result in the application of nutrients in excess to plant needs<sup>42</sup>; in such case bioavailable nutrients present in organic fertilising materials do not substitute their mineral fertiliser counterparts in a 1:1 ratio. This work relies on the so-called "maintenance substitution principle"<sup>42</sup> where potential plant nutrient uptake from organic fertilising materials are compared with general crop nutrient requirements for P and K, and any over-application is assumed not to substitute mineral fertilisers. It was assumed that the Potential Nutrient Uptake (PNU) from organic fertilising materials corresponds to  $90\%$  of the bioavailable P applied. Plant Nutrient Requirements (PNR) were valued at  $17.5\mathrm{kg}\mathrm{Pha}^{-1}$  and  $91\mathrm{kgKha}^{-1}$ , based on FAO data for crop P and K requirements<sup>39</sup> and offtake values<sup>43,44</sup> for productive cropland ecosystems. If PNU < PNR, then plant nutrient uptake is assumed equal to PNU. When PNU > PNR, then plant nutrient uptake is assumed equal to PNR, and any nutrients present in the excess fraction (PNR - PNU) were assumed to be stored in the soil (LDA) or lost to water bodies (HDA, equally distributed over surface- and groundwater). This is in line with the observed P leaching and runoff when P stocks in soils are P-saturated due to the long-term accumulation of excess P in soils in  $\mathrm{HDA}^{45}$ . The mineral fertiliser substitution efficiency for organic fertilising materials was calculated as the ratio of the plant nutrient uptake from the organic fertiliser by the plant nutrient uptake from a mineral fertiliser of the same total nutrient content.

It was assumed that  $89\%$  of the organic C applied on-land with the feedstock was mineralised within the considered time horizon of 100 years based on the figures reported in Brunn et al. (2006) for organic waste (ranging between  $8.2 - 13\%$  mostly depending on soil type); on this basis, a long-term storage of  $11\%$  of the input C content<sup>38</sup> was budgeted in the default calculation. The full inventory data for the use-on-land phase for organic fertilising materials is presented in Supplementary Table 2 (parameters # 31 to 90).

Background data for chemicals, materials, energy, and fuels used as input to the foreground system (i.e. technologies and processes) were mainly retrieved from the Ecoinvent v3.5 database, consequential system version (market processes). When not available, alternative datasets were used. Unit-costs, here reported as factor prices, were derived from various sources (refs. $^{2,20,46-62}$ ; see Supplementary Table 20).

# 3. Supplementary Methods

# 3.1 LCA approach

Supplementary Figure 6 illustrates the principles of the approach applied while Supplementary Figure 7 exemplifies the calculation of the internal cost for one selected scenario (NB3). The cost result for NB3 can then be compared to the cost of the rock phosphate-based pathway RP (NB3  $\leftrightarrow$  RP). Environmental impacts are calculated along the same principles.

# 3.2 Cost modelling

Following calculation principles for life cycle costing (ref.2), one-off budget costs (capital expenditure, i.e. CAPEX) are allocated equally between all tonnages of input-feedstock treated by a specific technology/process during the economic life time. This allows obtaining a cost per unit of input-feedstock processed. This implies first calculating the annuity where the one-off present cost is annualised (A; Eq. 1) and then dividing the annuity by the annual usage rate of the technology to obtain a fixed cost per technology involved in the processing  $(CI_f$ ; Eq. 2). Fixed annual costs such as insurance and maintenance are also divided by the annual usage rate to obtain a cost per unit of input-feedstock treated. The variable budget costs are calculated by multiplying the amount of an item used in the technology (see Supplementary Tables 14-to-18 for the technology inventory) by the corresponding unit-cost (see Supplementary Table 20) to obtain a variable cost per item involved in the processing  $(CI_v$ ; Eq. S3). Associated transfer costs are calculated similarly  $(CTI_v$ ; Eq. 4).

# 3.3 Parameter uncertainty propagation

Distribution and associated parameters used for the uncertainty propagation analysis are thoroughly detailed in Supplementary Table 2 for the case of High population and livestock Density Areas (default value  $c$  used in the baseline calculations and variance  $\sigma$  used in the uncertainty propagation; for triangurally distributed parameters the minimum  $a$  and maximum  $b$  are also reported). For the feedstock composition, a normal distribution was assumed on the basis of the information from ref. for manures and meat and bone meal, refs. for sewage sludge, and ref. for rock phosphate composition. For the remaining parameters a triangular distribution was used (Supplementary Table 2). The default value was used as the mode, and a minimum-maximum range was based, whenever possible, on information available from literature sources, technology operators, or our own calculations. With respect to the energy efficiency for incinerators and (bio)gas engine, a triangular distribution was assumed on the basis of the information reported by ref. For storage, the uncertainty ranges were narrowed by assuming best available storage practices, and based on information from literature (Supplementary Table 19). The uncertainty ranges for the use-onland parameters were derived as outlined in Supplementary Note 2.15 and 2.16. For transport, a triangular distribution ranging between a min of  $5\mathrm{km}$  and a max of  $100\mathrm{km}$  around the default value used in the baseline was assumed. When information was not available from literature sources, best-guess assumptions were taken (Supplementary Table 2). For most of the remaining technology-related parameters, a range of  $\pm 20\%$  around the default value was taken, assuming a triangular distribution. The same was done for materials, chemicals and facilities costs.

Parameter uncertainty was addressed using the propagation method described in ref<sup>11</sup>. This includes perturbation analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters to focus the effort on deriving uncertainty ranges for a reduced number of parameters, followed by uncertainty propagation to derive the overall uncertainty. The perturbation analysis consists of varying the individual parameters by a given value, typically  $10\%$ , one at a time while keeping the remaining ones fixed at their nominal value to evaluate which are the most sensitive and to calculate parameter-specific sensitivity coefficients for each scenario. The uncertainty of each individual parameter used in the model was then quantified analytically by multiplying the square of the parameter- and scenario-specific sensitivity coefficient with the analytical variance calculated from the uncertainty range assumed for the parameter. Finally, the total

uncertainty of the default results, for each impact category, was obtained as the sum of the contributions of the individual parameter uncertainties.

Conforming to the method described in ref.11, given that a small change  $\Delta x$  of an input parameter  $x$  leads to a change  $\Delta z$  in the result  $z$  for the category  $j$ , the sensitivity coefficient  $SC$  for the parameter  $x$  on the category  $j$  can be calculated as follows (Eq. 5):

$$
S C _ {x} ^ {j} = \frac {\Delta z j}{\Delta x i}
$$

# Equation 5

Assuming that  $Y$  is the result score for the impact category  $j$  in a selected scenario, the analytical uncertainty contribution from the generic parameter  $i$  can be calculated as follows (Eq. 6):

$$
V (Y) _ {i} ^ {j} = \left(S C _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {2} \cdot V _ {i n p u t} (X _ {i})
$$

# Equation 6

Where  $V_{input}$  is the variance derived from the initial uncertainty range associated to the  $i^{th}$  parameter  $X_{i}$  and can be associated with any type of underlying distribution (e.g. triangular, normal, uniform, or logarithmic). The analytical formulas to calculate the  $V_{input}$  departing from a given underlying distribution can be found in ref. [11] (Eq. 7 for a triangular distribution, given  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$ ). The total parametrical variance for the selected impact category  $j$  is then calculated as the sum of the uncertainty contributions from all the parameters  $n$  considered in the scenario (Eq. 8). The corresponding standard deviation  $V(Y)^j$ , assumed to be normally distributed, can then be derived.

$$
V _ {i n p u t} (X _ {i}) = \frac {1}{1 8} \cdot (a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - a b - a c - b c)
$$

# Equation 7

$$
V (Y) ^ {j} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \left(S C _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {2} \cdot V _ {i n p u t} (X _ {i}) \right]
$$

# Equation 8

# 3.4 Discernibility analysis

In the context of LCA, the discernibility analysis is a pair-by-pair evaluation of the difference between scenarios, aiming to present the percentage of occurrences where one scenario achieves better results than another (among the others, see ref.11). As stressed in previous studies, the uncertainty of the difference between two scenarios might depend on shared parameters, as often the scenarios have processes (and associated parameters) in common (e.g. two scenarios may have in common the same anaerobic digestion or incineration

process). Owing to this, some uncertainties may have the same influence on the two scenarios but no influence on their actual ranking as they cancel each other out when performing the discernibility analysis, i.e. the pair-by-pair evaluation of the difference between scenarios. To carry out the discernibility analysis, Montecarlo sampling (1000 iterations) needs to be performed on two selected scenarios (e.g. NB1 and RP) and the number of occurrences when one scenario performs better than the other one is counted, for each individual impact category under assessment. The final result is expressed as a percentage (e.g. number of occurrences when NB1 performs better than RP, divided by the total number of Montecarlo iterations) (Supplementary Table 1).
