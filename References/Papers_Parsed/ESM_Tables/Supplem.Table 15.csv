γ Corresponding to a methane production of 3.23 Nm3 CH4 (123 MJ). ,,,
δ It is assumed that the waste-heat from the gas engine is reused internally to heat the reactor (no external heat source required). ,,,
"ε Emissions are expressed per MJ of biogas-energy in input to the engine, based on ref. 13. ",,,
ζ Based on the figures reported in ref. 14. ,,,
η Annualised (Eq. 1 in Supplementary Methods) and divided by the annual usage rate (Eq. 2 in Supplementary Methods).,,,
